# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a rock-paper-scissors game written in Python. The computer randomly chooses an option and the player tries to beat it. The player can choose between rock, paper, and scissors. If the player's choice beats the computer's choice, the player wins. If the player's choice loses to the computer's choice, the computer wins. If the player's choice ties with the computer's choice, the game is tied.

To play the game, clone this repository and run the main.py file. The game will start and you will be able to play against the computer.

I hope you enjoy playing rock-paper-scissors!
